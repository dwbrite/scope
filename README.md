# scope
Scope is a tool for viewing and modifying project structures in a unique way.

## Contributing
Before you start, ensure that you have at least JDK version 8 installed. If you're on Linux, you may need to install `openjfx`. I also recommend setting up a [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/guide) file watcher in your IDE of choice. If you have any problems getting started, feel free to send me an email. You can find my email on my github profile.

### IntelliJ IDEA
Simply open the project from version control, configure the java version (if necessary), and start contributing!

### Eclipse
As far as I know, you should be able to import an IDEA project into Eclipse. I'm not sure about how well Eclipse supports VCS, but that should also be fine. 
Dependencies are located in the `dep` folder should they need to be configured further.
